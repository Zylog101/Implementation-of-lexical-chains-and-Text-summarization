- LexicalChainFinder responsible for creating lexical chains(Chains).
- FileHandler works with the file and gives word and its associated data whenever asked for.
- SimilarityFinder interacts using JWNL with WordNet and finds the relation among words.
- SummaryCreator responsible for creating the summary from Chains created.
- Chains main class to operate on the lexical chain data structure.
- ChainElement, WordElement are Data elements for Chains and data extraction from file.
-Properties.xml is responsible for configuring JWNL
this is where location of WordNet Database can be changed
currently its located in the project directory under the name "dict"

-changes to any other configuration can be done by seeing Report

Input:
"sentences" is the file where data to be processed is placed

Output: seen in console
